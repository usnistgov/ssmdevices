   Bases: :py:obj:`labbench.SerialLoggingDevice`

   Manage connection, acquisition, and data retreival on a single GPS device.
   The goal is to make GPS devices controllable somewhat like instruments:
   maintaining their own threads, and blocking during setup or stop
   command execution.

   Listener objects must implement an attach method with one argument
   consisting of the queue that the device manager uses to push data
   from the serial port.
