# ssmdevices API
The ssmdevices API organized as a collection of independent device wrappers for different instruments. The wrapper for each specific hardware model is encapsulated within its own class. As such, in many cases, it is possible to copy and adjust source code file that defines that class from the [`ssmdevices` repository](https://github.com/usnistgov/ssmdevices/tree/main/ssmdevices). If you implement a variant of the code to operate in your experiments, please feel free [to open an issue](https://github.com/usnistgov/ssmdevices/issues) to share your code so that we can fold your device back into the code base! 

The wrapper objects here are implemented on [labbench](https://github.com/usnistgov/labbench). An understanding of that module is not necessary to use these objects. However, labbench includes many useful tools for organizing the operation of multiple devices. Leveraging those capabilities can help to produce concise code that reads like pseudocode for an experimental procedure.
