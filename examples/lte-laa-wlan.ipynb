    "# Data Acquisition Example: Testing LTE-LAA/WLAN Coexistence\n",
    "_Originally by Yao Ma; revised and documented by Dan Kuester_\n",
    "\n",
    "The coexistence scenario here is the physical and MAC layers of an LTE-LAA downlink near 5 GHz (synthesized with 2 SDRs), and a COTS WLAN system is configured to operate in the same channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "A LabView VI runs the LTE-LAA mostly as a closed-loop system. The VI includes a UDP-based socket control interface, which we use here to configure the LTE-LAA and retreive throughput information. The general implementation of the socket interface is in [labbench](https://gitlab.nist.gov/ssm/labbench), so all we need to do here is create our own specialized version, `NI_LTE_LAA_Framework`, which definees the specific commands supported by this labview VI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test data for WLAN is implemented with the the iperf support in [ssmdevices](https://gitlab.nist.gov/ssm/ssmdevices). It produces many more columns of data than we need, so we just use the two defined in `ipc_columns`: throughput and a timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of the tests and the corresponding test conditions are stored in a [flat database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_file_database) stored in SQLite format. It is implemented as a typical intended use case of `labbench.RelationalDataInSQLite`. The test conditions are implemented as states in `NI_LTE_LAA_Framework` and `ssmdevices.software.IPerfClient`, so all we need to log these results into the database is to add the `db.on_set([lte_laa] + list(iperf_clients))`. Any states that are changed after that function call (for example, with the for loops in the acquisition code) become columns in the database; these values are automatically kept up to date and written to the database on calls to `db.write`."
